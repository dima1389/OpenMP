Executing task: D:\Projects\OpenMP\bin\04_performance\omp_timing_reduce_max.exe 80000000

OpenMP timing (reduction(max))
N = 80000000
Max threads available: 8

Effective parallel time (max thread): 11.123000 s
Computation sink (ignore): 6383999.998899

Interpretation:
  - Each thread measures its own elapsed time for the same parallel phase.
  - The effective execution time is the maximum of these local times.
  - reduction(max: ...) expresses this directly and avoids manual synchronization.
  - This pattern is suitable for clean performance experiments and scaling studies.
