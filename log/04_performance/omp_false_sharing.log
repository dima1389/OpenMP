Average timings over 5 repetitions:
  Packed: 0.000000 s
  Padded: 0.000000 s

Interpretation:
  - If Packed is significantly slower than Padded, false sharing is likely.
  - Padding places each thread's frequently-written counter in a different cache line,
    reducing coherence traffic and improving throughput.
  - Real applications often experience false sharing in arrays of structs, per-thread
    statistics, and frequently-updated counters.
