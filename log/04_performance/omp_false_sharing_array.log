OpenMP false sharing: AoS vs SoA (with padded AoS)
elements_per_thread = 1024, iters = 20000, reps = 5
Max threads available: 8
Assumed cache line size: 64 bytes

Expected checksum: 327680000

Rep 1/5:
  AoS:        time = 0.016000 s, checksum = 327680000
  SoA:        time = 0.035000 s, checksum = 327680000
  AoS padded: time = 0.046000 s, checksum = 327680000

Rep 2/5:
  AoS:        time = 0.020000 s, checksum = 327680000
  SoA:        time = 0.028000 s, checksum = 327680000
  AoS padded: time = 0.045000 s, checksum = 327680000

Rep 3/5:
  AoS:        time = 0.016000 s, checksum = 327680000
  SoA:        time = 0.031000 s, checksum = 327680000
  AoS padded: time = 0.051000 s, checksum = 327680000

Rep 4/5:
  AoS:        time = 0.015000 s, checksum = 327680000
  SoA:        time = 0.032000 s, checksum = 327680000
  AoS padded: time = 0.043000 s, checksum = 327680000

Rep 5/5:
  AoS:        time = 0.016000 s, checksum = 327680000
  SoA:        time = 0.031000 s, checksum = 327680000
  AoS padded: time = 0.052000 s, checksum = 327680000

Average timings over 5 repetitions:
  AoS:        0.016600 s
  SoA:        0.031400 s
  AoS padded: 0.047400 s

Ratios (higher means slower than padded AoS):
  AoS / AoS_padded: 0.35 x
  SoA / AoS_padded: 0.66 x

Interpretation:
  - If AoS is slower than AoS_padded, boundary false sharing is likely.
  - SoA vs AoS may differ due to memory layout effects and cache behavior.
  - Padding is an explicit mitigation but increases memory footprint.
  - Real codes typically mitigate false sharing by aligning/padding per-thread
    structures or by changing ownership/blocking to reduce boundary contention.
