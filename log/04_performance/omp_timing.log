Interpretation:
  - Each thread measures its own elapsed time for the same parallel phase.
  - The program's time-to-solution for that phase is bounded by the slowest thread.
  - Therefore, max(local_elapsed) is the most relevant timing metric in SPMD-style OpenMP.
  - Barriers around the timed region reduce measurement skew.
