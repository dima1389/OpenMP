Executing task: D:\Projects\OpenMP\bin\01_basics\omp_parallel_for.exe 100000000

OpenMP parallel for example
N = 100000000
Max threads available: 8

Parallel sum   = 5000000050000000
Serial formula = 5000000050000000
Result check: PASS
Elapsed time (parallel loop): 0.007000 s

Interpretation:
  - #pragma omp parallel for is the most common OpenMP construct for data-parallel loops.
  - Iterations are divided among threads automatically by the runtime.
  - The reduction clause safely combines partial results without explicit synchronization.
  - An implicit barrier occurs at the end of the loop unless 'nowait' is specified.
