OpenMP floating-point reduction demonstration (intermediate)
Series: H_N = sum_{i=1..N} (1.0 / i)
N = 100000000
Max threads available (omp_get_max_threads): 8

[Serial]   H_N = 18.997896413852555, time = 0.107000 s
[Reduced]  H_N = 18.997896413851894, time = 0.028000 s

Difference analysis (Reduced vs Serial):
  Absolute error: 6.6080474425689317e-13
  Relative error: 3.4783048073420337e-14

Interpretation:
  - If the results differ slightly, this is expected due to floating-point
    rounding and different summation order in the reduction tree.
  - If you require reproducible results, you need a reproducible summation
    approach (fixed reduction tree or compensated summation).
