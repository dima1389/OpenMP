OpenMP atomic vs critical (with reduction baseline)
Total increments N = 200000000
Max threads available: 8

Results:
  atomic:    counter=200000000, time=5.784000 s
  critical:  counter=200000000, time=6.282000 s
  reduction: counter=200000000, time=0.000000 s

Validation:
  PASS: all methods produced the expected result.

Interpretation:
  - atomic protects a single read-modify-write update and is usually cheaper
    than critical for simple operations such as counter increments.
  - critical provides mutual exclusion for an arbitrary code block, but can
    impose higher overhead and serialization.
  - reduction is often the best choice for associative/commutative operations
    because it minimizes contention (per-thread partial results).
