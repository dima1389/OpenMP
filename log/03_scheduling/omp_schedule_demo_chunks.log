OpenMP scheduling demo (chunk size sensitivity)
N = 5000000, pattern = 1, chunk = 1
Max threads available: 8
Runtime schedule: kind=2, chunk=1

Timings (seconds):
  static (1):   26.064000
  dynamic(1):   31.063000
  guided (1):   30.427000
  runtime:       30.872000  (OMP_SCHEDULE)

Interpretation:
  - Smaller chunks improve load balance but increase scheduling overhead.
  - Larger chunks reduce overhead but risk load imbalance.
  - dynamic/guided schedules benefit most from careful chunk tuning.
  - runtime allows experimentation without recompilation.
