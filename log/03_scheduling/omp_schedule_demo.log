OpenMP scheduling demonstration
N = 500000 iterations, pattern = 1
Max threads available: 8
Current OpenMP runtime schedule: dynamic, chunk = 1

Timings (seconds):
  schedule(static,1):   2.323000
  schedule(dynamic,1):  2.315000
  schedule(guided,1):   2.395000
  schedule(runtime):    2.625000  (set OMP_SCHEDULE)

Interpretation guidelines:
  - static:  lowest overhead, but can load-imbalance for uneven iteration costs.
  - dynamic: better balance, higher overhead due to runtime work assignment.
  - guided:  starts with large chunks, decreases chunk size; often good balance.
  - runtime: schedule chosen externally via OMP_SCHEDULE for experimentation.

Examples:
  export OMP_SCHEDULE="dynamic,1024"; ./omp_schedule_demo 500000 1
  export OMP_SCHEDULE="guided";       ./omp_schedule_demo 500000 1
