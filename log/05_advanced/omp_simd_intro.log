OpenMP SIMD introduction
Kernel: y[i] = a*x[i] + y[i]
N = 50000000, reps = 5
Max threads available: 8

Timings:
  serial:            0.348000 s
  omp simd:          0.320000 s
  parallel for simd: 0.365000 s

Checksums:
  serial:            359900262.370398
  omp simd:          359900262.370398
  parallel for simd: 359900262.370398

Result check: PASS (checksums match exactly)

Interpretation:
  - omp simd requests vectorization within a single thread.
  - parallel for simd combines multithreading with SIMD in each thread.
  - SIMD effectiveness depends on contiguous access, alignment, and no loop-carried dependencies.
  - Use compiler vectorization reports to confirm actual SIMD code generation.
