OpenMP tasks introduction
Compute Fibonacci(n) with task parallelism
n = 40, cutoff = 20
Max threads available: 8

Result: Fibonacci(40) = 102334155
Elapsed time: 0.135000 s

Interpretation:
  - Tasks allow irregular and recursive parallelism that does not fit a simple
    parallel-for loop.
  - The cutoff parameter controls task granularity; too small => many tasks and
    high overhead; too large => insufficient parallelism.
  - The OpenMP runtime schedules tasks across threads dynamically.
