Interpretation:
  - Tasks from different pipeline items may execute concurrently.
  - Within a single item, Stage A -> B -> C ordering is enforced
    purely by depend clauses (no barriers or taskwait).
  - The runtime builds a task dependency graph (DAG) and schedules
    tasks as soon as their dependencies are satisfied.
