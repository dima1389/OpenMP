# OpenMP
OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) for shared-memory parallel programming on multicore CPUs. It provides a portable, standardized, and incremental way to express parallelism in C, C++, and Fortran programs using compiler directives, runtime library routines, and environment variables.
